# PingLatency

This projects uses Apple's Simple Ping, modified to ping the relevant host 5 times (by default) and display the average latency for this host. An MVVM approach is used because of the asynchronous nature of the app and this is its main strength - clear separation of concerns, modularised code for enhanced testability, complete decoupling between views and model/services mediated by the view models. The app also handles concurrency well, executing any http requests (including image download) on the utility thread, leaving the main thread free for the user interface.

The main flaw is that the PingService only works as a singleton, and therefore ping requests to multiple hosts have to be serialised, hence the rather horrible chaining of callbacks in the HostTableViewModel! Ideally, each TableViewCellModel would be initialised with its own instance of PingService so that ping requests could be run conncurently but when I attempted this the PingService did not initialise properly. Any suggestions on how to fix this would be gratefully received! Unit test coverage could also be better. At the moment, it only covers the services. Again, the asynchrounous nature of the app makes this a little tricky but this could be easily managed through the use of mock objects and dependency injection.
